## 9 Evaluation

Emacs has three different kinds of form that are evaluated differently: symbols, lists, and “all other types”.


#### self-evaluating forms

A self-evaluating form is any form that is not a list or symbol. Self-evaluating forms evaluate
to themselves: the result of evaluation is the same object that was evaluated. Thus, the
number 25 evaluates to 25, and the string "foo" evaluates to the string "foo". Likewise,
evaluating a vector does not cause evaluation of the elements of the vector—it returns the
same vector with its contents unchanged.


#### symbol forms



#### classification of list forms

A form that is a nonempty list is either a function call, a macro call, or a special form,
according to its first element. These three kinds of forms are evaluated in different ways,
described below. The remaining list elements constitute the arguments for the function,
macro, or special form.
